# DeepCL
Educational Deep Learning framework based on C++ and OpenCL

This is a Deep Learning framework I wrote during my Master thesis.
It creates a static computation graph, with Template Metaprogramming, which will then be executed during executing time.
The static computation graph is used for automatic differentation,allowing differentation through arbitrary mathematical expressions implemented in this framework.
It fokuses mainly on Convolutional Neural Networks and normal Feed Forward Neural Networks.

## Example
The bin directory contains a executable that trains the LeNet model, using the CPU or GPU, on the MNIST dataset. 
In the following images an execution on the MNIST dataset is displayed.

In order to run the example, download the .exe file as well as the Kernel folder.
## Installation
